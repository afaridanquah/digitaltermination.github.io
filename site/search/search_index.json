The various codes we return are outlined on the right side.\n\n\nAll errors should be returned in the form of JSON along with a message which explains the issue in plain english. When a validation error occurs return the name of the field which is invalid one by one, so if you forgot to include two fields, only the name of the first field will be returned.\n\n\nHTTP Status Codes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Code\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n400\n\n\nBad Request -- Your request is invalid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401\n\n\nUnauthorized -- Your API key is wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n403\n\n\nForbidden -- The simplito requested is hidden for administrators only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n404\n\n\nNot Found -- The specified simplito could not be found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n405\n\n\nMethod Not Allowed -- You tried to access a simplito with an invalid method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n406\n\n\nNot Acceptable -- You requested a format that isn't json.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n410\n\n\nGone -- The simplito requested has been removed from our servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n418\n\n\nI'm a teapot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n429\n\n\nToo Many Requests -- You're requesting too many simplito Slow down!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n500\n\n\nInternal Server Error -- We had a problem with our server.
